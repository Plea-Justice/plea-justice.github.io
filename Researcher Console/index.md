The researcher console provides an interface for researchers to change the flow of the simulation, including the script and animation assets, making it possible for them to design variations of the simulation for their own research (i.e., by manipulating a number of different plea-relevant variables).
It allows the flow of the simulation to be modified, including the script and animation assets,
and makes it possible to design scenarios with storylines that vary sacross experimental conditions.
