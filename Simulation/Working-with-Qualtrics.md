# Working with Qualtrics 

Certain simulation parameters may be manipulated within Qualtrics. These parameters may set or be randomly assigned in Qualtrics' embedded data and then sent to the simulation via a [query string](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/standard-elements/passing-information-through-query-strings/) with the simulation's URL.

The simulation will also send data back to Qualtrics in this way. For instance, the features a participant has selected for his or her avatar and answers to any prompts within the simulation may be passed back to Qualtrics in the query string.  

## Controlling the Simulation

| To assign simulation options, such to assign a participant to a particular condition, assign the option in a Qualtrics embedded data variable. |

| At the custom end block in which the participant is redirected to the simulation, add embedded data to the URL query. |

| `http://pleajustice.org/simulation.html?condition=${e://Field/condition}` |

The following table lists the variables that may be manipulated via the simulation URL.

| URL Query Parameter | Possible Values | Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| Name | Any word less than 20 characters. | The participant's first name, gathered within Qualtrics. |
| condition | Any whole number. | 



## Recieving Data in Qualtrics

URL Parameter | Example value | Status        | What is it?
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Name|test||subject's name (for testing you must use something with test in it i.e. test)
module|1||determines which scenario will be used first
Locale|en_US
S|bip||guilt
email|test@student.uml.edu||must include test for testing
modcounter|1||determines if the survey is on the first or second randomized scenario
SURL|https://umasslowell.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1ZgWdnbRrtFLPdr||survey url
conviction_chance| 0, 1 or 2| | randomized between 0, 1, or 2 to determine if the defense attorneys estimated chance of conviction is 20, 50, or 80 percent respectively
conviction_months| 0, 1 or 2| | randomized between 0, 1, or 2 to determine if the plea deal jail sentence length would be 6, 12, or 18 months respectively
