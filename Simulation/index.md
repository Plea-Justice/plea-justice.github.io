The plea bargain simulation allows researchers to test participant's legal decisions through
a computer simulation which offers enhanced participant immersion and ecological validity.

You may view a demo of the simulation [here](http://demo.pleajustice.org).

For creating new animations from scratch or editing existing:
* Adobe Animate (Part of Adobe Creative Cloud)
> _This is only if you want to add completely new scenes to the simulation. Existing scenes can be rearranged and the scripts may be changed without this software._

To run the simulation on your own:
* A web server or static hosting
* A domain name

If serving manually with your own static provider, most have a simple to use upload tool. Select "Manual Download" in the publishing options of your scenario and upload the contents of the `.zip` to your provider. See [this example from Dreamhost](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003490852-Using-the-website-file-manager-in-the-panel) for more information.
> _Simulations may also be run on the project's existing server. Request access and you will be able to immediately publish from the scenario editor._
