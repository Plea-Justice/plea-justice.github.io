Under these settings, hidden layers WILL NOT be published, just fyi. Don’t rely on stage color to produce a background. Stage color is omitted in publishing by Animate. If a background color is needed, such as a solid yellow background for Scenario2_Intro_Figure0 (or 1).fla, create an explicit background layer with the rectangle shape taking up full stage and color it. Use Classic Tweens in Adobe Animate where possible. Any animated figure should be a Graphic symbol with a minimal walk cycle. Moving the animated figure across the stage should be done with time-saving Classic Tween whenever possible (vs. frame-by-frame animation). Take care to backup your working fla files on your own backup drive as well as on the shared drive. When uploading files, please do it under your own unique user and not as a shared user so contributions can be properly attributed. In other words, don’t log into drive as the admin@pleajustice.org user to upload. Upload your ‘condensed’ files as described in Deliverables above to their appropriate folders and overwrite the old files with the same name.

In the future these need to be vector js as well to maintain a responsive user experience. | Drawn text for narration scenes: text that is rasterized aka “broken” and baked into an image or clip. | . Keeping in mind when and how to report to supervisors is important. This is also a general summary of the entire process from start to finish: . | Create Concept Art . | Think of what you are creating and why. Are you creating a defense attorney? Do you want them to seem incredibly competent, overworked? These things will be factors, potentially, in the research results. Come up with several variations before moving on. | . | Respond to feedback, change designs according to Supervisor feedback. | Once designs are approved, storyboarding must be done to get into full swing. Reference the script a lot during this portion of the process. During this process there should be at least 2 reviews of the storyboards so that the full intent of the script can be properly conveyed before animating begins. | Once the storyboards are finalized, as well as the concept art, you begin by creating a rough draft animation. This can be several layers, but keeping them rough and minimal is preferred. Once again, this process should have at least 2 revisions in order to assure quality of work, optimal script cohesion, and style matching. | The rough approval ends the beginning work for the animation, but it doesn’t end the need for style matching guidance. Refer to style guides (do we have these?) and have supervisors provide regular feedback on the assets. | As you move on to the final version, regularly uploading and publishing videos to Google Drive / Documentation / Animation Review for regular online review by supervisors is a must. The final animation needs to be matching in style, have believable motion, and follow the script in a way that promotes the quality of research your supervisor needs. | . ",

This format is computer readable, the values are typically comma-separated, and you must use correct syntax for the file to be read properly.

There are two types of scenes. The first is a premade animation scene. This uses a movie clip and does not contain any dialogue or script. { \"name\":\"Introduction\", \"clip\":\"IntroClip0\" }, . This creates a scene called Introduction. The scene will play a premade movie clip asset called IntroClip0. The second type of scene is a custom dialogue scene. This type of scene contains an “actor” animation asset and text from a script that will be rendered dialogue on the screen. { \"name\":\"Prosecutor Says Hello\", \"actor\":\"prosecutorActor\", \"fg\":\"None\", \"bg\":\"meetingroom\", \"script\":\"Hello, my name is Mr. Clark.\" }, .

If a participant is assigned to condition 7, they will view the premade movie clip animation IntroClip0 followed by the custom animation Prosecutor Says Hello, in which text appears in the speech box “Hello, my name is Mr. Clark”.

In these cases, data in the first row is written into the output file, and data from the same column of further row will not be written to the output file. | Column Name | Interaction | . | “LinkID” | The script will find the LinkID across rows and attempt to merge data between the two rows. Data from the first row will be written to the output file; this includes redundant values of the same column but also data where the values of the same column are different. Below are columns where there are exceptions to this behavior. | . | “email” | The script will combine values from the rows and remove the comma because data from this row is typically a single comma or the full email address. The resulting string will be written to the output file. | . | “Duration (in seconds)” | The script will add all values from all the rows together and write the total to the output file. | . | ID_1 or ID_2 | The script will check these values if they are “123456” and save the whole LinkID to a separate data structure dedicated to test entires. If this data structure is populated, then a second output file will be created, populated with entries where this variable’s value is “123456”. | .

The publishing script is a small computer program written in Python which modifies the .js files exported by Adobe Animate such that they may be added to the simulation. Before running the script, make sure Animate layers follow the required [naming convention][/simulation/docs/art-documentation] as well as the above color palette rules. To run the publishing script you will need Python 3 installed. The script may be found at src/modules/assets/publishing-scripts/publish.py. Run the publishing script in a terminal (command-line) with the following commands. cd src/modules/assets/publishing-scripts/ python publish.py [filename] . Example: . python publish.py AllScenarios_Jail.js . In this case, AllScenarios_Jail.fla has been exported from Adobe Animate as AllScenarios_Jail.js this file has then been moved to the same directory as the publishing script. The publishing script has now been run, and we may now use AllScenarios_Jail.js as a scene in the simulation. Technical Details . Adobe Animate exports .fla animations as JavaScript objects that may be rendered in a browser with the CreateJs library. The .js output of Animate requires modifications before it can be used with the simulation. The publishing script does several things: . | Replaces the reserved palette colors to JavaScript variable names so they can be set dynamically based on the participants’ avatar customizations. | Prepends if statements to avatar feature layers (eyes, hair), allowing them to be similarly toggled on and off with variables. | Prepends if statements to all avatar layers associated with a figure to allow toggling between body shapes. | Replaces the lib object in which the animation object is stored by Animate with a global lib. (An issue introduced by Animate 17.5). | Prepends // Published. to the beginning of the file and checks for this line before running to ensure the script is never accidentally run more than once. | .

Here “h4sh12” is their email address bob@smith.com run through a hashing function. Alternatively we could maybe just pass the email in directly (but url escaped), so qualtrics would generate . the_program.com/c1?uid=bob%40smith.com . We can then have the_program hash the email and pass it back to the qualtrics ending survey as a hash in the query string, to be stored in the survey using that query string to variable capture technique qualtrics already has .

I’ve included them on this email as well. Yes, it is possible to generate a unique URL link with their email address. You’ll need to go through the following process to accomplish this task: . | Create a text entry question where the respondent will input their email (or whatever identifier you want to use). | Make a second question (make sure this question is in a separate “Block” from the above text entry question) you can paste the link to the second survey and add a query string to the end of this URL.

The participant avatar appears in a room approaching the defense attorney who is already seated at a table. The simulation shows the defense attorney in a room with a closed door behind him. With his greeting, it is implied that the participant is no longer in the jail cell and is in a private room. DEFENSE ATTORNEY: . Hello, {User}. I am your defense attorney, Mr. Grant. Mr. Clark, the prosecutor on your case is interested in seeing whether this case could be resolved without a trial. » . Based on the security camera footage and testimony from the salesclerk, Mr. Clark believes that he could win if this case goes to trial. » . If this case does go to trial, Mr. Clark will be seeking the maximum penalty of 12 months in jail. » .

According to the information provided in the police report, the defendant requested a pair of sunglasses in a locked case from the salesclerk. » . The salesclerk provided the sunglasses to the defendant who allegedly walked away with them in order to examine them in a mirror. » . Once the salesclerk’s attention was diverted to another customer, the defendant exited the store wearing the sunglasses. » . The salesclerk positively identified the defendant as the person who walked out of the store wearing the missing pair of sunglasses. » . There is also security footage provided by the owner of the sunglasses shop where the theft occurred that shows the defendant committing this crime as described. » . Grainy security footage shows the inside of the store from above the salesclerk’s perspective at a bird’s eye view. The avatar walks into the view of the camera, approaches the clerk’s desk, and turns around appearing to be talking to the salesclerk. The avatar obtains a pair of sunglasses from the salesclerk and puts it on after the clerk grabs the pair of glasses from under the desk. The avatar walks away from the desk to another table, slides the glasses over their head, and then checks their phone. The avatar then walks out beyond the view of the camera, disappearing from the security footage. PROSECUTOR: . The security footage shows {User} wearing the missing pair of designer sunglasses and heading toward the exit of the store. Theft of these sunglasses is a clear larceny, which, given the value of these glasses is considered a felony offense punishable by significant fines and/or imprisonment. » . We request a court date be set by the State as soon as it is possible. In the meantime, we request {User} be held until a time that bail can be set and paid. » . JUDGE: . {User}, you are being charged with larceny, a felony carrying imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years, or by a fine of not more than $25,000 and imprisonment in jail for not more than two years. » . You have the right to request the appointment of counsel if you cannot afford counsel; the right to not make a statement; and the right to a jury trial, judgment, and sentencing before a district judge. » . At this time you are remanded to a holding cell where you will await a bail hearing, which will occur within the next 48 hours—at that hearing, a bond will be assessed for conditional bail. It is so ordered. » . The avatar is shown to be in a prison cell, with their eyes closed, arms crossed, and appears to be thinking to themselves. AVATAR: . I know I remember the day the prosecutor is talking about … » . The flashback sequence begins. Here, the simulation shows two different sequences depending on whether the avatar is guilty or innocent. If innocent: . A hand sets a pair of sunglasses down on a table and it is shown that the avatar walks across the lobby of the mall, in the opposite direction they arrived from the beginning of the simulation. Back in the jail cell: . AVATAR: . I know I didn’t return the sunglasses to the salesclerk, but I did remember to leave them on the counter before I left the store. I’m innocent! » . If guilty: . The avatar is shown walking down the lobby of the mall with a pair of sunglasses on their head, in the opposite direction they arrived from the beginning of the simulation. Back in the jail cell: . AVATAR: . I know I forgot to take those sunglasses off before I left. I should have returned them… But, I was afraid they’d think I intended to steal them. Now, I’m really in trouble! » . The participant avatar appears in a room approaching the prosecutor (the same prosecutor from the arraignment) who is already seated at a table. The simulation actually shows the same prosecutor from the arraignment in a room with a closed door behind him. With his greeting it is implied that the participant is no longer in the jail cell and is in a private room. PROSECUTOR: . Hello again, {User}. We are currently working on a court date, but I would like to see whether we could resolve this at the bail hearing without a trial. » . Based on the security camera footage and the testimony from the salesclerk, I am confident that I would win this case if it progressed to a trial. If I take this to court, I will be seeking the maximum penalty of 2 years in jail and the maximum fine of $25,000. » . If you plead guilty now, saving myself and the State the resources needed for a formal trial, I am prepared to recommend that the judge sentence you to 6 months of jail time. » . I will also recommend that the fines be charged at $370, the cost of the sunglasses, plus court costs. » . If you accept this plea arrangement, you will need to sign this form, which includes the recommendations I just described. » . Note again that if I am forced to take this case to trial, I will pursue the maximum jail sentence of 2 years and the maximum fine of $25,000. » . Your signature will indicate your agreement to plead guilty and forgo your right to a trial. » . The prosecutor disappears from the screen and two buttons as well as text in the dialogue box roll out onto the screen. Awaiting the participant’s response of clicking one of the two buttons, the participant will be redirected to one of two corresponding Qualtrics surveys depending on their response to this situation. BUTTONS: . [Plead Guilty] / [Reject Offer] . DIALOGUE: . Plead guilty in exchange for a lower sentence (6 months in jail and $370 in fines) . Reject the offer and risk a more severe sentence if found guilty at trial (2 years in jail and $25,000 in fines) . The participant must click one of the buttons and respond with Plead Guilty or Reject Offer in order to proceed in the study to the post-simulation survey questions. ",

The avatar obtains a pair of sunglasses from the salesclerk and puts it on after the clerk grabs the pair of glasses from under the desk. The avatar walks away from the desk to another table, slides the glasses over their head, and then checks their phone. The avatar then walks out beyond the view of the camera, disappearing from the security footage. PROSECUTOR: . The security footage shows {User} wearing the missing pair of designer sunglasses and heading toward the store exit. Theft of these sunglasses is a clear larceny, which, given the value of these glasses is considered a felony offense punishable by imprisonment. » . We request a court date be set by the State as soon as it is possible.» . JUDGE: . {User}, you are being charged with larceny. » . You have the right to request the appointment of counsel if you cannot afford counsel; the right to not make a statement; and the right to a jury trial, judgment, and sentencing before a district judge. » . At this time, you will be held until counsel has been assigned to you, which will occur within the next 48 hours. » . The avatar is shown to be in a jail cell, with their eyes closed, arms crossed, and appears to be thinking to themselves. AVATAR: . I know I remember the day Mr. Clark is talking about … » . The flashback sequence begins. Here, the simulation shows two different sequences depending on whether the avatar is guilty or innocent. If innocent: . A hand sets a pair of sunglasses down on a table and it is shown that the avatar walks across the lobby of the mall, in the opposite direction they arrived from the beginning of the simulation. Back in the jail cell: . AVATAR: . I couldn’t return the sunglasses to the salesclerk because he was helping another customer, but I did remember to leave them on the counter before I left the store. I know I’m innocent. Someone else must have swiped them! » . If guilty: . The avatar is shown walking down the lobby of the mall with a pair of sunglasses on their head, in the opposite direction they arrived from the beginning of the simulation. Back in the jail cell: . AVATAR: . I know I forgot to take those sunglasses off before I left. I should have returned them…But, I was afraid they’d think I intended to steal them. I guess I’m guilty of this! » . The participant avatar appears in a room approaching the defense attorney who is already seated at a table. The simulation shows the defense attorney in a room with a closed door behind him. With his greeting, it is implied that the participant is no longer in the jail cell and is in a private room. DEFENSE ATTORNEY: . Hello, {User}. I am your defense attorney, Mr. Grant. Mr. Clark, the prosecutor on your case is interested in seeing whether this case could be resolved without a trial. » . Based on the security camera footage and testimony from the salesclerk, I would estimate that you have a 20/50/80 percent chance of being convicted if this case goes to trial. » . If this case does go to trial, Mr. Clark will be seeking the maximum penalty of 24 months in jail. » . If you plead guilty now, saving the State the resources needed for a formal trial, Mr. Clark is prepared to recommend that the district court judge sentence you to 6/12/18 months rather than 24 months in jail. » . If you accept this plea offer, you will be asked to sign this form, which includes the recommendations for lower sentencing that I just described. If you reject this plea offer and take your case to trial, Mr. Clark will pursue the maximum jail sentence of 24 months. » . Your signature will indicate your agreement to plead guilty and forgo your right to a trial. » . The defense attorney disappears from the screen and two buttons as well as text in the dialogue box roll out onto the screen. Awaiting the participant’s response of clicking one of the two buttons, the participant will be redirected to one of two corresponding Qualtrics surveys depending on their response to this situation. BUTTONS: . [Plead Guilty] / [Reject Offer] . DIALOGUE: . Plead guilty in exchange for a lower sentence (6/12/18 months in jail) . Reject the offer and risk a more severe sentence if found guilty at trial (24 months in jail) . The participant must click one of the buttons and respond with Plead Guilty or Reject Offer in order to proceed in the study to the post-simulation survey questions. ",

The indexing of frames is important, as the actor.js class in the engine peels the asset file apart in context to the given scene dialogue. Actor files are used by Dialogue Scenes in the engine, with the engine jumping from frame to to frame arbitrarily in response to scene dialogue. Foreground/Background Art . These are .png files which are overlaid or underlaid against an actor in a dialogue/monologue (inner monologue about flashbacks) scene. Palettization . Both Movie Clip and Actor files must be processed for palettization if the user avatar is present, so that any color changes made by the user are reflected in the content. This is done through a publishing script, which replaces specific color codes with variable references.

    "content": "This is a Qualtrics survey, which begins and ends each experiment (informed consent to start off, then follow-up questions at the very end). The module expects a provision of url parameters (such as whether to show the guilty or not guilty version of the module, the user name) which are generated by the Qualtrics survey and then passed to the simulation. Once the simulation completes, it sends the user back to the same Qualtrics survey with url parameters indicating any decisions made during the simulation. The Qualtrics is especially set up via branching to act as an informed consent prologue if these parameters are not present, and as a follow-up epilogue. Flow . The flow of the Qualtrics survey is very important. If post-simulation url parameters are present, then the survey must flow directly into post-simulation questions. If the post-simulation url parameters are not present, then the survey must flow to pre-simulation processing. Pre-simulation processing . Gaining user informed consent, recording their user name and email, randomly generating values such as guilty/not-guilty, and other such information as required by the simulation module are to be done in this section of the flow. Once recorded/generated, these data should be passed as url parameters to the simulation module .html on the web server. See previous simulation surveys in Testing &amp; Debugging for an example. NOTE: the id of the Qualtrics survey itself is passed as a url parameter, and is required in order to properly reload the Qualtrics survey for post-simulation questions. Post-simulation questions . These are handled by the Principle Investigator. Ensure that any in-simulation data required by the Principle Investigator (such as decisions made in-simulation) are passed as url parameters by the simulation and parsed as data values within the Qualtrics survey.

It is critical that this flow be assigned after all other elements are declared - or the module will crash. Notes for Future . Flow respective of avatar customization is cumbersome with the current implementation, requiring a lot of boilerplate flow with minor conditionals to differentiate clips. This would be best improved with a standardized json-based flow management system, which was under development but was abandoned. Module configuration would be made significantly better if this replacement implementation were completed and requisite changes to the Renderer made. ",

    "title": "The Engine",
    "content": "This is the workhorse of the project, which loads and handles the display of assets in accordance to the specifications of the module. It is defined in library files, which will be briefly overviewed below. General Rendering Overview . Rendering assets is done in the createJS canvas, with the renderer placing assets into the canvas, setting them to an appropriate frame contextually, and then clearing the canvas before iterating to the next frame. The particulars of this generalization come out in the how each asset type is processed. Scene Rendering . The scene, which contains a ‘speaking’ character, needs to be responsive to the text on screen. Thus, a script text string, made up of the text to display as if the character were speaking (with additional formatting characters), is used to determine which mouthshape to display. The animation file created by the animation team has specific mouthshapes keyed to the frame index of the animation file, these are then jumped to by the renderer in response to the script. The rendered for Scenes is configured so that the character, foreground, and background can all be set as null, to allow for ‘disembodied voice’ text display. Clip Rendering . A clip, which contains a fully animated scene which is not controlled by a text script but instead is completely pre-generated, is displayed through use of the Clip class of scene in the renderer. These do not include a text script, nor foreground or background elements. Clip selection is based on avatar customization, e.g. Scenario2_Intro_Figure0_H0E0.js (first hairstyle and eyes) vs Scenario2_Intro_Figure0_H2E1.js (third hairstyle and second eyes). Scenes, Frame and Renderer . (Refactoring of Terminology Recommended) The Renderer handles all asset display within the canvas. Movie clips and dialogue/monologue scenes are encapsulated within a class Scene. These two subclasses are called Clip and Scene. It is recommended to rename the subclass Scene to Dialogue in the future, as its name is anachronistic due to predating its now-parent class. In the Renderer a Frame class contains the current Scene and .next is loaded from the module manifest in accordance to button controls to indicate the next Clip or Dialogue. The simulation is performed by advancing the Frame from the initialScene. Clips and Dialogue contain null stubs for properties found in the alternative which are not present in themselves - this could be improved with fallback functionality for more proper polymorphism. It is possible to support alternative variants with similar polymorphism practices as required by future modules (and better customizable avatar support). createJS standards are used when possible, though are broken for the purposes of displaying Dialogue. Actor.js and Parser.js . These describe how an actor asset file is to be handled by the text parsing system, and how the text should be displayed in the text box. These are used by the Dialogue variant of Scene to reduce workload of Animation team. Params . This contains methods for parsing url parameters. UI . This defines and handles the display of the text box, Advancer (a button which advances to the next Scene from the current Scene), and general Button definitions. Avatar Customizer . This displays an avatar to the screen, and the user can use the controls provided to select figure types, eyes, or hair styles, as well as different colors for features (hair, eyes, skin, and outfit). When the user is finished selecting the avatar they want, they hit the Next button, which passes the avatar’s data through URL parameters to the simulations. ",

The link will bring you to a landing page where you will be asked to give informed consent where there will be two text-entry fields. The first will ask you to enter your first name to be used in the simulation; the second will request a UML student email address (because the primary study for which the simulation was used recruited students from UMass Lowell). Entering the string “[any characters]@student.uml.edu” in this text-entry box will allow you to proceed. Features . Avatar Customization . Using this avatar creation interface, users are allowed to customize their own avatar to be used in the simulation with predefined assets. Controls are provided to select figure types, eye types, or hair styles, as well as selecting a color for the hair, eyes, skin, and shirt. Animation &amp; Dialogue . | | . The user is presented with one of two unique scenarios featuring the customized avatar the user created – one with the avatar driving and the other with the avatar browsing for a pair of glasses at the mall. These animated sequences provide context to the user as they illustrate sequences of events that occur before the avatar receives a summons and is ordered to appear in court. | | . Both sequences lead up to the avatar being summoned to court and asked to either accept a plea offer and plead guilty, or go to trial. The user navigates the simulation by clicking the “»” button as it appears (when the dialogue has stopped); as the simulation progresses, they learn more about the incident surrounding their avatar (e.g., whether they are innocent or guilty of the crime to which they are accused). Modifiable Values &amp; Recording Responses in Qualtrics . The simulation concludes by offering the user the option to either plead guilty and accept the plea offer or reject it. The option the user selects, alongside other variables scattered throughout the simulation, are then saved and passed as parameters into Qualtrics. Although it is separate from this software, the platform contains features to incorporate conditional logic in the survey flow based on variables expressed in the simulation (e.g. guilt status, plea offer type, sentencing duration). Installing . Note: The current implementation of the project has the source and asset files deployed onto a server, which allows those with server access to run the simulation without downloading any of the files. Instructions on how to set up a remote web server for this project will be coming soon. To run the simulation on your own local machine, download the source code by cloning the GitHub repository through Command Line with, . git clone https://github.com/Plea-Justice/pleabargain-simulation.git . or download and extract the zip file on the desktop site. Once the files are on your machine, create a local web server by way of navigating to the folder of the project in the terminal and typing either python3 -m http.server or http-server. | To download Python, visit the Python homepage and download the release that corresponds to your operating system. | To download http-server, here is the link to the http-server README on the NPM (Node Package Manager) webpage. | .

Actions do any logic before state is touched and are primarily used for committing to mutations. Actions are async, while mutations are sync. For standardization Actions should call Mutations with any arguments encapsulated inside an object { arg1, arg2, ... }. This object should then be captured in the corresponding Mutation as payload (state, payload). One notable exception that is made is for axios responses the response data is sent as: . | these setter methods are different to begin with | this reduces dot notation chaining for already embedded objects | the payload should only ever be the response for these type of actions. | . Actions and Mutations should also be given different names for clarity. Modifying State . Vue.set() and Vue.delete() can be used for both arrays and objects. However, several array manipulations are wrapped push(), pop(), splice(), etc. to allow reactivity so they should be used for arrays. This can provide more specific context on how an array is being manipulated and makes differentiating between wether a stateful arrays or objects is being modified easier.

    "content": "A flattened or normalized pattern is used where any nesting is extrapolated away. What this basically means is individual item objects are encapsulated inside an object keyed by their (the items) ID. While access to their ID’s is provided through an Array, generally these arrays should also be ordered and are where all the ordering happens. The naming convention is to have objects describe the items e.g. boxes and the array have a postfix of List after the singular of the singular form of the objects descriptor e.g. boxList. This effect can then be chained. boxList (array) -&gt; boxes[boxId] (Object) -&gt; boxes[boxId].scenes (array of itemId's) -&gt; items[itemId] (Object). Why . This pattern is popular across several other state libraries as well as VueX, helps to ensure errors or performance issues don’t occur regarding reactivity and triggering re-renders, and creates a maintainable pattern since it’s straightforward what each object should look like. scenes.js . Manages the state of the layout from frames to scenes, any modification to those objects, and the exposes the default form information provided in each scene (but does not manage the form.) . The scenes state is comprised of four elements and is modeled below . conditionsLengths: [], frames: {}, frameList: [], scenes: {} . condtionLenghts serves as a reference for the length of each condition in their primitive/original orientation. ex. [1, 3, 5] tells us there are 3 conditions where condition 1 has 1 scene, 2 has 3 scenes, etc. frames: {} holds information for each frame. | id allows a frame to be aware of itself when used in Vue Components | scenes is a list of sceneId’s within that frame | . frames = { frameId: { id: frameId, scenes: [sceneId, ...] }, ... } . scenes: {} holds information for each scene . scenes = { sceneId: { id: sceneId, props: { /* This is where all the saved properties for a scene are held e.g. name, background, etc. */ } } } .
